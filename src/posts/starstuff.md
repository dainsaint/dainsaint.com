*“The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.”*
-- Carl Sagan

inspired by star trek, i wrote this "heroic" theme for [space opera](/space-opera).

it's written and exported straight from [musescore studio](https://musescore.org), using the honestly impressive orchestral soundfont they released in version 4.
