*“The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.”*
-- Carl Sagan

inspired by jerry goldsmith's TNG theme, with a bit of bruce broughton's theme for The Orville, i wrote this main theme for [space opera](/space-opera), to be played at the start and/or end of sessions.

it's written and exported straight from [musescore studio](https://musescore.org), using the honestly impressive orchestral soundfont they released in version 4. 

since part of what we're hoping to do with the experience is have live music, it's my biggest hope to have musicians take/quote/chop/remix the central motif throughout the session as our players navigate decision-making on a generational scale.
