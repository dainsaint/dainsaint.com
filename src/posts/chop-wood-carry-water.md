today is a day to throw out  
that piece of moldy fruit in you fridge  
that has sat for months because  
something else was more urgent  

>

today is a day to breathe  
not because you have to  
not to stay alive  
but because the air is yours  
and you should take it

>

today is a day to cry  
not because you are sad  
or angry beyond words  
but because you will feel lighter  
with no tears to carry  

>

today is a day to do nothing  
nothing at all  
because your simple existence  
is defiance enough  

>

the days will come heavy  
and loud and painful  
but they will come  
and i am looking forward  
to ███ing with you  
for the next hundred years
