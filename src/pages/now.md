### media i'm in love with
* [x-men '97](https://gizmodo.com/x-men-97-cyclops-scott-summers-marvel-disney-plus-1851364191) is killing it.
* [worlds beyond number](https://worldsbeyondnumber.com) is one of the most beautiful pieces of media i've experienced this decade. well worth the $5 a month for everything.
* finally opened up the [broken earth trilogy](https://nkjemisin.com/series/the-broken-earth/). devoured it in a week. [nk jemisin](), y'all. if i start talking about how _good_ this is i'll never ever stop.
* currently reading [children of virtue and vengance](https://tomiadeyemi.com/the-writer/) — can't _wait_ for "anguish and anarchy" to drop this summer.
