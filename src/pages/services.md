I specialize in interactive design, story systems, and creative direction for storytelling experiences of all kinds.
There are three ways to work with me:

<div class="card stack light" style="--card-background:rgb(97, 5, 51); --primary: rgb(97, 5, 51)">

*For museums, cultural institutions, and creative studios:*

## :fa-hand-sparkles: Let's make something magical together {.text-display}

### movement work • actual play • game design • poetry • music • performance • that weird shit {.content-wide}

I love teaming up with artists, designers, and storytellers chasing something weird, tender, or full of wonder. If you’re deep in a project—or just sitting with a spark—[I’d love to hear about it](/email).
{.text-lede}

If you're working on something interactive and dope, but don’t have a big budget, I still wanna hear about it! I’m open to barter, skill swaps, mutual aid, co-creation—anything rooted in trust and care. Let’s figure out what feels fair for both of us.

More than anything, I want to link with folks tryna build something neither of us could make alone. [Drop me an email](/email) and let me know what's on your heart!
