Classically trained. Juliard schooled. (Absolutely not.)
{.lede} 

But I *am* the lead composer and sound designer for games like [Auditorium](https://cipherprime.com/games/auditorium) and [Splice](https://cipherprime.com/games/splice). Over the years, I've cobbled together a musical practice from spare parts of soundtracks, video games, and soul music. 

As a composer, I write music for games, film, and stage. I've written everything from minimal piano soundscapes to pulsing electronic soundtracks, all with an eye to creating atmosphere and telling a story without words.

My style mixes cinematic orchestral, electronic, jazz, blues, and Caribbean diasporic traditions to ground the listener in immersive experiences.
