Dain Saint is a storyteller who creates with sounds and systems. He has produced over a dozen commercially-released games with Cipher Prime Studios, written soundtracks for the same, and directed Emmy-award winning series for the Philadelphia Inquirer. 

He has created art exhibitions and museum installations, and is always looking for beautiful ways to connect people.

As a writer, he has released a book of poetry called “Freedom Is Non-Negotiable”, and performed and released music as a solo artist.

He is a massive nerd.
