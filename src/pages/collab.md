_You're making a game: virtual, tabletop, or otherwise. You want your players to have a certain emotional experience, or tell a specific kind of story — and you're feeling lost in a million charts and mechanics. How do you bridge the gap between systems and stories?_

_You're developing a music-driven project, but you're not a musician — or you're unsure of how to best use music and sound effects to generate the emotional response you're going for. Maybe it needs to react to your audience in real-time, or work as more than a soundtrack in the background. How do you use sound to make your project sing?_ 

_You're creating a museum installation. There's such a long list of information that needs to be given to an audience, but there has to be a better way than endless menus no one wants to spend time with. How do you make information interactive, compelling, and exciting?_

_You're planning an ambitious editorial series. You have a sense of the mission, but you're struggling with the sheer scale of what you are trying to accomplish. You need a visual identity, a clear way to talk about your project, and just so many collaborators to pull this off. How do you tie a loose collection of stories into a coherent vision?_
