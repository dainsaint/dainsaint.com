### you are...
a game designer. or an author. or a performer. maybe you're a musician, maybe you're a journalist. maybe you wear so many hats that picking a label is pointless. 

what matters is this: **you have a vision**.

you want to put something beautiful in the world, and you want nothing more in life than to make dope shit with dope people aligned with liberation and abundance.

### i am...
a multi-disciplinary media artist. i primarily work with words, music, and interactivity — something i refer to as **stories, sounds, and systems**. but yeah, i've done videos and games and talks and live events, too.

i'm creatively promiscious that way.

i can either get it done, or find someone who can. i'm at my best when the work is meaningful.
