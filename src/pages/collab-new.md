_You're making a game: virtual, tabletop, or otherwise. You want your players to have a certain emotional experience, or tell a specific kind of story — and you're feeling lost in a million charts and mechanics. How do you bridge the gap between systems and stories?_

_You're developing a music-driven project, but you're not a musician — or you're unsure of how to best use music and sound effects to generate the emotional response you're going for. Maybe it needs to react to your audience in real-time, or work as more than a soundtrack in the background. How do you use sound to make your project sing?_ 

_You're creating a museum installation. There's such a long list of information that needs to be given to an audience, but there has to be a better way than endless menus no one wants to spend time with. How do you make information interactive, compelling, and exciting?_

_You're planning an ambitious series. You have a sense of the mission, but you're struggling with the sheer scale of what you are trying to accomplish. You need a visual identity, a clear way to talk about your project, and just so many collaborators to pull this off. How do you tie a loose collection of stories into a coherent vision?_

### clients and collaborators

I'm not sold on including this — I feel like I usually see these for like agencies more so than individuals, but I cant tell if this is helpful or crass.

What does "turning stories into experiences" mean?
{.lede}

Well, the natural world is made of matter and energy. But the social world is made of stories, and our internal worlds — our memories — are made of our experiences.

So turning a story into an experience, at its heart, means turning a simple narrative into something worth remembering.

Sometimes that means finding the emotional core. Sometimes that means making sure your design reinforces your central message in a thousand subtle ways. 

Sometimes it's making sure this is the story you want to tell in the first place. 

It _usually_ means making your audience a part of the story. It means turning your story into a place people want to spend time — physical, virtual, or otherwise. It _definitely_ means making it something they carry with them long after they've gone home.






## top six reasons people have reached out to me
AKA "What you came here to find out in the first place."

1. **Can you help us design an interactive story?**
  TKTK Client POV. Something like "We're working on a story that we feel would benefit from interactive elements, but we have no idea what that could entail. Could you walk us through the process of making something good?" 
2. **Can you develop our game systems?**
  TKTK These should be written from the POV of the client.
3. **Can you design our live immersive event?**
  TKTK These should be written from the POV of the client.
4. **Can you compose music for our story?**
  TKTK These should be written from the POV of the client.
5. **Can you help me tell my story in a unique way?**
  TKTK These should be written from the POV of the client.
6. **Will you come perform or speak at our event?**  
  I'd love to! My [performances](/performance) are a blend of music, poetry, and storytelling, and we can take it from quiet and intimate to loud and obnoxious.  
  I've also given talks on everything from why the [universe is a video game](/the-universe) to why [music is a fundamental part of being human](/humansong). Either way, people usually have a good time, and I murder the ones that don't. (Gotta keep that rating up somehow.)
