I co-founded **cipher prime** with [will stallwood](https://willstall.com) in 2009. We made **ten games in ten years**, including Auditorium and Splice. More info about our games, including our list of awards and ways to buy, are all available at [cipherprime.com](https://cipherprime.com).

Much love to aaron chapin, andrei marks, nikkolai davenport, jackie grubner, and the rest of the CP family <3.
