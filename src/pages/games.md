I make pretty, engaging, absurd little games.
{.text-lede}

Games are how we learnâ€”about ourselves, each other, and the world. Also, they're just *fun*. I love creating beautiful experiences that let people engage with the absurdity of the world around them with a light touch and an open heart. Whether digital or analog, there's a trillion ways to play, and I'd love to find just a few.

I co-founded **cipher prime** with [will stallwood](https://willstall.com) in 2009. We made **ten games in ten years**, including Auditorium and Splice. More info about our games, including our list of awards and ways to buy, are all available at [cipherprime.com](https://cipherprime.com).

Much love to aaron chapin, andrei marks, nikkolai davenport, jackie grubner, and the rest of the CP family <3.
