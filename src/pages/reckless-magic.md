## interactive storytelling for URL and IRL{.text-display .push-loose .content-wide}

**Reckless Magic** delivers custom interactive experiences for museums, cultural spaces, and creative studios. 
{.text-lede}

From immersive installations to event storytelling, we'll bring together worldbuilding, spatial design, game systems, and sound to create stories people step into — experiences that don’t just inform, but transform.

I’ve spent over fifteen years crafting interactive experiences through games, journalism, exhibitions, and live performance. **Reckless Magic** is the next evolution — a service focused on building narrative-rich installations for cultural spaces ready to dream big.

Yo! This is my corporate offering — if you're tryna cook outside of capitalism, head over [here](/services#join-forces).

## you’ve got a message... but no one's feeling it.{.text-title}

You're a museum, cultural space, or creative studio with a message that matters. But you keep getting stuck with:

* Visitors rushing through exhibits without connecting
* Programs that attract interest, but don’t spark return visits or conversation
* Complex stories flattened into dry panels or dense reports
* Narratives that fall short on cultural nuance, authenticity, or community resonance
* Projects that look good but feel hollow, with no energy or emotional buy-in

You don't just need design — you need magic.

**You need interactive storytelling.**

  <strong>what is interactive storytelling?</strong>
</summary>

There are many definitions, but in this case, I mean ***“any experience where the person receiving the story has a chance to alter it.”***

This casts a pretty wide net, and includes can include things from video games and websites (URL) to events and exhibitions (IRL).

Making storytelling that is interactive and engaging is both a specific discipline and a way of using a wide palette of skills.

I have designed this kind of interactive storytelling for projects across:

* Narrative design
* TTRPG Mechanics

:::
### Exhibitions

Whether you’ve got a half-formed idea or a full team looking for direction, [let’s talk](/book). I bring story systems, sensory design, music, code, and performance — a multi-disciplinary spellbook for conjuring storyworlds that listen, shift, and respond.
