# Current Pain Points
Your editorial workflow is inefficient to non-existent — everything is written in Google Docs and manually pasted into the CMS, causing formatting issues and redundancy. Planning and scheduling are decentralized across Slack, Google Drive, and Calendar. You have no preview functionality, no way to properly attribute media, and no feeling of platform mastery. You have to rely heavily on interpersonal communication to get basic content over the finish line. Your current CMS, built on Vercel, lacks flexibility, visual integration, role-based permissions, and rich media functionality. 

On the frontend, the site is brutalist, difficult to read, difficult to navigate, and invisible to search. There’s no feeling of connection to your social presence, and no feeling of invitation for the reader to spend time on the site and see everything you have to offer.

# Desires for the Future
You’re looking for a CMS that supports a cohesive, inviting visual identity, integrates visuals and writing seamlessly, and accommodates varied content types (photo essays, video, calendars). Success looks like organized information, accessible storytelling, contributor visibility, and space for artist collaborations. You want to avoid traditional news tropes and instead create a flexible, community-oriented platform that will meet you where you are today and grow with you over the next five years. 

# Four Key Focus Areas

1. **Ease of Use** – Intuitive editorial workflows with scheduling, previews, roles/permissions. Contributors should feel a level of comfort and mastery over the CMS. Readers should find the site easy to read and accessible for various ways of ingesting information.
2. **Organization** – Support for categories, verticals, calendars, and backend information architecture that reflects how you organize knowledge. This should be dynamic and responsive, so you can shift and reorganize as you discover new ways to connect with your community.
3. **Stability** – You shouldn’t feel afraid to make decisions on the backend, or risk doing things live because the platform doesn’t support previews. Experimenting with plugins and new story forms should be intuitive and not require the bottleneck of a developer in every instance. Your content should be portable so that should you need to change platforms in the future it is as painless as possible. The site should Just Work™️.
4. **Beauty** – A warm, inviting aesthetic that encourages reading, clear fonts, and thoughtful visual integration, and space to explore and grow with artist collaborations, while uplifting the beauty of the work you are already doing. Your website should feel like part of the same visual voice that informs your social media.
