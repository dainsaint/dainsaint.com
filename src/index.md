Dain Saint makes experiences out of stories, sounds, and systems. He has produced over a dozen commercially-released games with [Cipher Prime Studios](https://cipherprime.com), written [soundtracks](https://cipherprime.bandcamp.com) for the same, and directed [Emmy-award winning series](https://inquirer.com/wildestdreams) for the Philadelphia Inquirer. 

He has created [art exhibitions](https://wevetraveledsofar.com) and [museum installations](https://www.phillyseaport.org/exhibits/river-alive/), and is always looking for beautiful ways to connect people.

As a writer, he has released a book of poetry called “[Freedom Is Non-Negotiable”](/freedom-is-non-negotiable), and performed and released music as a [solo artist](/city-dont-sing).

He is a [massive nerd](https://dainsaint.bandcamp.com/album/pieces-of-8).
