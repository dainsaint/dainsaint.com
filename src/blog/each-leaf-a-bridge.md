You asked, "How am I meant to enjoy spring?" 

At a time like this? With so much pain and strife, when the bombs are still falling, and the ground still shaking, and the pain of a hundred generations still cutting through my bones? How are we meant to enjoy spring when those with power collect more power still and our pleas for civility and decency cannot be heard over the din of cash registers and weapon contracts paid in full; over the cacophony of ancestor and kin alike torn apart by tax dollars, and no end peeking golden on any horizon?

How do I feel joy when there is so much pain?

You believe you can feel their pain, yes? Not believe, *know*. Know deep in your bones that even without the breathless coverage, the constancy of social media, the calendar days tallied in blood, that you would know, would feel on some level the agony being visited upon your people. You believe that there is an indelible connection to you, and that no distance or distraction or dissociation could keep that psychic pain from ringing in your very cells. A cell in El Salvador filled; a cell in your heart snaps. You *know* this thing to be true, that no force in this world could keep you from feeling their pain.

How, then, can you not *know* that they feel your joy?

How, then, can you *not* enjoy the sacredness of spring? The coming of life after the dark winter, the assertion of the natural order in an unnatural place? How can you not hold your people in your heart as you walk and say, "Brother, the trees are green again?"

How can you not see the quiet resilience in each blossom? To see trees growing in a place where they were once cut down for fear of crime, fear of the other, and see them grow regardless? To know that despite the machinations of evil men to blacken the skies and poison the seas and style themselves as gods, they are in truth so weak they cannot stop a single flower from blossoming?

The smell of this spring is the smell of patient resistance; the colors in the trees our banners raised high â€” white flowers and green leaves and red berries floating carefree over black earth.

This joy is a sacred gift, and gifts are to be shared. This bridge connects us. If their pain must be ours, let our joy be theirs. Let their pain be our motivation. Let our joy be their strength. 

Brother, the trees are green.  
Sister, the flowers bloom.  
Father, the wind is sweet.  
Mother, we will be home soon.
