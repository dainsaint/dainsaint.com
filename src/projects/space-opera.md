**Space Opera** is a sci-fi/fantasy game engine for building empowered community. Participants gather over several days to collectively tell the story of how the societies they create survive, navigate, and dream amongst the stars. It brings participants together with a team of game masters and performer/facilitators in a unique combination of gameplay and theatricality.

i've been having a blast working with the crew at [obvious agency](https://www.obvious-agency.com/) on this wild experience. stay tuned for playtest dates!
